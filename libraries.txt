MotorMC uses several libraries to aid in cryptography, compression, and other essential functions.
Here are all of the libraries MotorMC uses:

( Library  - What it's used for                       <- Why it's used )

GMP        - RSA encryption and math                  <- Best solution
OpenSSL    - cryptographic hashes, and AES encryption <- Best solution
libcURL    - auth requests                            <- Only solution with desired functions, relys on OpenSSL
libdeflate - compression                              <- Best solution
